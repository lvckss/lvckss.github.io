    <b>what are you trying to achieve?</b>

    I'm trying to understand the complexities and nuances of modern society.

    <br>
    <b>what are your interests?</b>

    <b>Philosophical Views:</b>
    <br>
    I'm influenced by Nietzsche's Ãœbermensch and Christian ethics. I don't follow the latter for faith or heavenly rewards, but as a personal ethical choice. My blend of philosophies is both a personal journey and a blueprint for how I believe society thrives when grounded in strong ethics.
    <br>
    Moral responsibility is what matters most.
